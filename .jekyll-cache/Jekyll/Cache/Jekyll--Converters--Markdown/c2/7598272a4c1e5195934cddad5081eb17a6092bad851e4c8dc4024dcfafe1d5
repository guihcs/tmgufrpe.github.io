I"þ<p>Increasing and / or Alternative Communication Systems (SCAAs) are examples of Assistive Technologies that help people with speech difficulties. Generally, SCAAs manage a vocabulary without semantic language knowledge. This knowledge enables the user to provide a fast, intuitive, predictive way to build well-formed sentences during communication. In order for these improvements to be applied in a real scenario, it is possible to use Ontology as a framework for knowledge representation, however the ontology must have instances in its classes to be used. Inserting instances manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a domain expert. Given that the approaches in the literature depend on domain, this factor decreases its applicability due to the various changes to be made to obtain good results. In order to mitigate such problems, this work proposes an architecture to perform the automatic ontology settlement for SCAA vocabulary enrichment, applying techniques of Natural Language Processing, techniques for meaning disambiguation, enrichment of features, technique for grouping and resizing of data (Self-Oganization Maps), among others. The results so far show that in-depth semantic analysis provides important information for word classification.</p>
